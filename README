Code which supports the Living Map - powered by Arduino and HERE maps.  For more details see www.gt140.co.uk

The Living Map is an Arduino project which displays traffic conditions on the M60 (Manchester UK) using RGB LEDs (WS2801).

arduino/living_map.ino - the main Arduino code.  Uses an Ethernet Shield to retrieve information from the php pages.  Uses EasyTransfer library to call a second Arduino with a Sound Shield attached.
arduino/audio_slave.ino - the slave code which runs on the second Arduino and plays sounds using the Sound Shield.
php/living_map.php - php which retrieves information from the HERE Maps API and reformats it for easy consumption by an Arduino.
php/twitter_mentions.php - php which retrieves the last mention on Twitter for a given account (uses TwitterExchange.php) and reformats it for easy consumption by an Arduino.
